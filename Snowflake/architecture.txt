There are 2 type of Architecture:

1. Shared Disk
- All compute nodes share the same storage (common disk), but each node has its own CPU and memory.
- Compute Nodes read/write to the same disk, but coordinate to avoid conflicts.

2. Shared Nothing 
- Each node has its own CPU, memory, and storage, and nothing is shared.
- Compute Nodes communicate over the network and distribute data across machines.
- Better and independent scalability, preformance 

3. Snowflake Architecture:
- Data Storage Layer: Just like Shared disk, snowflake have a central data repository. Data is stored in compressed columnar storage format maintained by snowflake itself. Also, data is automatically organised into micro-partitions (encrypted using AES256, 50-500MB in size) which make query processing more easier and faster. Data is not visible direct via cloud but only through snowflake.
- Virtual Warehouse Layer (compute layer): On the other hand it use MPP masive parallel processing to process the query. sizes are - X-Small - 6XL. Each WH i.e is independent of each other i.e. it can scale independently without impacting other compute/warehouses.
- Cloud Service layer: It is the brain, and control things like Authentication and access control, optimization, metadata management (tbl count, partition count, min max, etc), security, RBAC, data sharing, query optimization
