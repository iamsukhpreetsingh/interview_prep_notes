What is timetravel?

- Retrieving data-related objects like DB, tables, schemas that are changed/deleted.
- Snowflake store data in micropartitions and micropartitons are immutabe. If you want/have to update the data, snowflake will create a new micropartition instead of updating to old one. 
- the old micropartitons with old data will be kept with snowflake for some duration, which is configured by MAX RETENTION TIME (1-90days) get expired. Once this get expired (MRT) it will go to fail safe zone (upto 7 days for permanent tables)
- each table in schema follows the retention time of its parent object. if schema have 1 then table will have 1 as default retention time and if 10 then 10. similarly each schema in database follow retention time of its parent DB, UNTIL you explicitely change it for particular object.

Command:
	ALTER TABLE tbl
	SET DATA_RETENTION_TIE_IN_DAYS=10;
	
	ALTER SCHEMA QUESTIONS
	SET DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS = 2;
		
	
To undrop object:
	UNDROP Schema schema_name
	

- We have 3 ways to query historical data;
1.  At specific time/day
  	SELECT * FROM tbl at(timestamp => ''::timestamp_tz)
  
2.   At specific minutes before
  	SELECT * FROM tbl at(offset => -60)
    
3.  By query id
  	SELECT * FROM tbl before(statement => 'query_id')
